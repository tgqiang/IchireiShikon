In the original UnityFileExtensions.cs in 'Extension Methods for Unity' package,
there exists a bug in file-saving operatives.
 
Before manual developer correction, in their primary
'SaveTo(this string data, string path)' method, it invokes
the following line of code when performing file-save:

...

// save the data
File.WriteAllText(data, path);

However, in C#, the 'File.WriteAllText' function is defined as:
File.WriteAllText(string path, string contents).

Please note that this has been manually rectified by GeeCue.
